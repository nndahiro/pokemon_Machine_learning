# pokemon_Machine_learning
A machine learning approach to predicting pokemon types based on a database of pictures.

These days there are almost too many pokemon to account with almost 900 different kind
span over 8 generations (and counting). Yet, with so many choices to pick from, when playing
the game it is of utmost importance to have a balanced team. Pokemon are divided into 18
different **types** broadly based off "elemental" or conceptual ideas. These include: fire, grass,
water, fighting, fairy, flying and more...
The challenge now becomes, how to tell a pokemon type simply by looking at it? Is it even possible?

These types can usually be discriminated from by the human eye: Fire types have flames,
water types are blue...
However, as more and more pokemon are created by Nintendo and GameFreak, it is less and less easy
to simply look at a pokemon and predict the type. As a fan of the series I prided myself on
being able to predict a pokemon's type by looking at it. So I wondered if it was possible to teach a
computer to learn the same.

As it is the 21st century and humanity is enjoying a period of "Throw AI at it" I decided to build a Neural
Network to 1) Learn how to do this, and 2) see if neural nets can solve this problem.

Pokemon can be up to 2 **types**(by this I mean the pokemon's element) but can also be 1 type or a pure type.

pokemonIt would be nice indeed to be able to predict a pokemon type just from a picture
