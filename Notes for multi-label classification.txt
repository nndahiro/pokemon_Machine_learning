Multi-Label Classification
The only difference is that a data sample can belong to multiple classes. 
We have to handle a few things differently in multi-label classification.
Activation Function
The final score for each class should be independent of each other. 
Thus we can not apply softmax activation, because softmax converts the
 score into probabilities taking other scores into consideration.

Data Imbalance in Multi-Label Classification:
For example, if a dataset consists of 100 cat and 900 dog images.
If we train the neural net on this data, it will just learn to predict
dog every time

Databases used:
809 pokemon pngs, also arranged by type: https://github.com/rileynwong/pokemon-images-dataset-by-type

Have error handling:
For example File error things. Do it in the core functions.
